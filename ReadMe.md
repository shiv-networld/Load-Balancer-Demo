Demonstrating Load Balancer
----------------------------

What is Load Balancer?
	A load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and 
	routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests.
	
	This is a small illustration shown with 2 algorithms,
	(1) Random algorithm
	(2) Round Robin algorithm
	
Start point?
